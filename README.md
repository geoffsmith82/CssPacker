## Program Description

DM CSS Un-packer is a piece of software designed to convert a packed CSS file into a more readable format.

Have you ever seen a website and wondered how the CSS code was written? Have you ever tried to view the source only to find it is a jumbled mess with all the text on one line?

This little gem provides an easy way to *un-pack* CSS code, making it easier to read by:

- Inserting line breaks  
- Restoring removed spaces  
- Indenting lines appropriately
